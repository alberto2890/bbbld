Big Blue Button Learning Dashboard Monitoring System

Welcome to the bbbld wiki!

This repository is made for the Big blue button Learning Dashboard.

The aim here is to facilitate access to the learning dashboard files from third party software and to access the json file without using an API.

You need basic nodejs knowledge to perform these operations.

You need to publish the project in a folder in the big blue button server.

It will come with nodejs installed on your current server. You can publish your project with pm2.

The project is set to broadcast from port 9000. To change this, you can change line 65 in the app.js file.

Also, for BBB Learning Dashboard links, you need to edit the 3rd line of app/routes/index.js according to your own address.

If you would like to contribute to the project, we would be very happy.

Maybe a development that automatically transfers to MySql can be considered in the future.

stay well
